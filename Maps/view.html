            <p>If CyberScope was unable to resolve geo-location of an IP address, then it will not show up on the map.</p>
            <p>The country of an IP address can be determined with approximately 95-99% accuracy.</p>
            <p>The exact city in which an IP address is located can have varying levels of accuracy, from 50-75% accuracy, so take these measurements and precise coordinates as an estimate.</p>
